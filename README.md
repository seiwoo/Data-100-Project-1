# Data-100-Project-1

## Project A1 
Performed basic Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to understand the underlying structure and distribution of the dataset. Enhanced the dataset by engineering new features and simultaneously conducted data cleaning to improve overall data quality and model readiness.

## Project A2 
Specify and fit a linear model for the purpose of prediction. Finally, analyze the error of the model and brainstorm ways to improve the model's performance.
