# Data-100-Project-1 (UC Berkeley Class Project)
**Programming Language** : Python
## Project A1 
Performed basic Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to understand the underlying structure and distribution of the dataset. Enhanced the dataset by engineering new features and simultaneously conducted data cleaning to improve overall data quality and model readiness.

The dataset consists of over 500,000 records from Cook County, Illinois, the county where Chicago is located. The dataset has 61 features in total; the 62nd is Sale Price. 
## Project A2 
Specified and fitted a linear regression model for predictive analysis. Conducted an error evaluation of the modelâ€™s performance and explored potential strategies for further improvement, including feature engineering and model optimization techniques.
